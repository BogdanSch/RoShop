Specify products that cause Free Shipping to not be available when they are in the cart.

== Description ==

**Let's say your customer has the following products in their cart:**<br>

1. Paper Airplane
1. Box of playing cards
1. A Grand Piano

You offer "free shipping for orders over $50" but you specify that some restrictions apply.

Naturally the Grand Piano will cost quite a bit to ship so you don't want to offer free shipping on this order.

With this plugin, the Grand Piano can be marked "Exclude Free Shipping" which means the user will pay for shipping of this unique item. See screenshots for a visual example.

**Works for Simple Products, Variable Products, and even Variations!**<br>

**I have many products that I need to update. How can I do this quickly?**<br>
This plugin is compatible with our **<a href="https://pimwick.com/pw-bulk-edit">PW WooCommerce Bulk Edit Pro</a>** plugin.<br>
Quickly update the products that should be excluded from the Free Shipping offer.
